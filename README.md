GitHub Language
===============

A Sinatra application where a user can enter an arbitrary GitHub username, and be presented with a best guess of the GitHub user's favourite programming language. It uses the GitHub API to retrieve repo data for a given user and then attempts to calculate the user's dominant programming language based on the data returned from the API.

##Running Tests

To run RSpec tests just use the command "rspec"
